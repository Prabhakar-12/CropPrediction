🌾 Crop Price Prediction using Random Forest Classifier
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the price category of agricultural crops (e.g., low, medium, high) based on various input features such as soil condition, rainfall, temperature, region, season, and crop type. I used the Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning method, for this classification task.

🔍 Why Random Forest?
Random Forest was chosen for its:

Ability to handle both numerical and categorical data

Resistance to overfitting

High accuracy and robustness

Interpretability of feature importance

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for model building

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

🔢 Workflow
Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathered crop data with historical price and environmental attributes.

Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables and normalized where necessary.

Model Training: Trained a RandomForestClassifier to classify crop prices into categories.

Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Prediction: Used the trained model to predict the price category of new crop data.

📈 Results
The model achieved promising accuracy, demonstrating its potential for helping farmers and stakeholders make better pricing decisions. Feature importance analysis also revealed which environmental factors most influence crop prices.

🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate more real-time data (e.g., live weather APIs)

Try other classifiers (XGBoost, SVM)

Deploy the model as a web application
